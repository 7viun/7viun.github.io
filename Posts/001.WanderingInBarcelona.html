                <h2>Wandering in Barcelone</h2>
                <p>After spending huge amount of times in the lab, I will have some of my first trip abroad with my pal - who is also my colocataire and my friend during university time. So I think it worth sometimes telling about the “on the way” journey to Barcelona. We do not have the route to travel directly from Lyon to Barcelona or vice versa, so you can choose either one here: 1- Take a flight; 2- Take a bus. So as a student with strictly budget base on my monthly salary in the lab and monthly scholarship fee, the wise “sage” of self-consciousness tells me to choose the cheaper way of bus route. Well, but direct bus route from Lyon would take about 8 to 9 hours, a devastated trip for me. So I managed to mobilize all my planning capacity power to cut off the trip in two parts: take the train to Bordeaux, almost south border of France with Spain then take the bus to the heart of Barcelona, well there is the plan and more fun to come.</p>

                <p>So perhaps you may already know, the cheapest way to travel for foreign students in France would be the TGV - which imo the second fastest on land public transport worldwide. I mentioned my strict budget for the trip before right? So we chose the night train about 22:00 which means we would arrive in Bordeaux at about 23:30, there we will have to wait only couple of hours till 3:00 the next early morning for the bus. Sounds legit right? All was planned explicitly perfect (or I thought so at the time). </p>
                <p>We arrived in Bordeaux when it is pit dark, the station was nice though. The dorm shape steel structure looks elegantly from the inside. It is a bit late so almost all the interior lights are off, which amplify much more the sharp edges of the building. We travelled in April, winter passed by for one or two month. The bitter cold of spring brings freshness feeling to my mind when I walk out of the train station trying to catch a local bus to the nearest destination of my bus to Barcelona. </p>

                <p>The bus-stop of my 3:00AM bus stays near a recreation neighborhood in the urban area of Bordeaux. It is quite late in the night, a couple of bars still shed the light on the street. I cannot remember correctly which types of music I heard they were playing, but it was vaguely blue in my mind. We found a spot to settle a little waiting for the bus, outside of Domino Pizza outlet. And it was some night to remember, the freezing carves in my mind as night gets later and later. I hardly managed to sleep, I dozed off a little bit but my buddy sleeps straight till 3:00 with me - his bodyguard lol. </p>

                <p>Finally, the travel time comes, we gather all our stuffs, cover and deepen ourselves in the coat to avoid splashing wind of April at 3:00AM. Walking to the appointed position, I do feel quite lonely as we are the only one waiting there. Then 5 minutes, 10 minutes and 15 minutes passing by of the appointed time, still tranquil street and quiet station. Stirring a feeling lost sensation in my mind, I do feel a little bit scared for our trip. But luckily, a couple marching toward us dragging with them their valises. By the look, I supposed that they are students just like us, a strong sensation of relieve. Briefly after, the white bus approached slowly with Barcelona banner. Climbing on the bus, I slept straight till morning and the first sight is the warm welcome of Mediterranean - the embraced lover of Barcelona.</p>
